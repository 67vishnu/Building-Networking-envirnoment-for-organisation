Building an Efficient Environment for the Organization – Cisco Packet Tracer
This project focuses on designing and implementing an optimized network infrastructure for an organization using Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal is to create a secure, scalable, and efficient network that enhances communication, resource sharing, and overall operational efficiency.

✨ Features:
Network Topology Design – Structuring a robust and scalable network.
Routing & Switching – Implementing VLANs, static & dynamic routing (OSPF, EIGRP).
Security Measures – Configuring firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), and secure protocols.
Device Configuration – Setting up routers, switches, and end devices with appropriate IP addressing.
Performance Optimization – Ensuring minimal latency and efficient data flow.

🛠️ Tools Used:
Cisco Packet Tracer – For simulation and testing.
Networking Protocols – VLANs, STP, RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, DHCP, NAT, etc.

🚀 How to Use:
Download and open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Review the topology and device configurations.

Test network connectivity and troubleshoot if needed.

📌 Future Enhancements:
Implementing cloud integration and IoT devices.
Enhancing network security with intrusion detection systems.
